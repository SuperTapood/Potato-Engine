# Potato Engine

A basic LWJGL based framework to handle some low level LWJGL functions.

note to self - an example documentation thing is at the public Text method in text.java

todo:
- integrate the scene thing into the window
- make sure that scene to scene transition works (use the GlobalData window pointer)
