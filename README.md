# Potato Engine

A basic LWJGL based framework to handle some low level LWJGL functions.

note to self - an example documentation thing is at the public Text method in text.java

todo:

- fix issue where drawing image makes the text disappear
- add shape classes (rect, triangle, circle, and arc (a partial circle))
- create a test scene (frame counter, and button that says exit that closes the window)
- make sure that scene to scene transition works (use the GlobalData window pointer)
- clean up the repo of artifacts (and move testing to a separate directory)
- maybe find a way to export the project to jar for easier use in external projects (
