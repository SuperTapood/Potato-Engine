# Potato Engine

A basic LWJGL based framework to handle some low level LWJGL functions.

to do:

- change scale to size in text stuff
- add StaticText (for static text that doesn't change)
- add DynamicText (for dynamically changing the text)
- add Button class (with on hover, on click events)
- add Scene master class and have it properly integrate with the button's hierarchy
